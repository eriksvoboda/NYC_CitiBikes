# NYC CitiBikes

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to use the bike sharing data to create multiple charts to visualize the data in different ways. This will be ued in a presentation to solidify a business proposal for a bike sharing program in Des Moines. 

## Results

Using the CitiBike data we can visualize the data in mulitple manners as seen below. These charts provide unique insight that will help with our proposal. 

### User Checkout Times

The number of bikes checked out along with the mintues of the trip duration.

## Summary

Using these visualizations we can learn that the average trip duration is 6 minutes. Males checkout the bikes more often than females, but 6 mintues is the average duration still. Friday through Monday the most popular times for usage of the bikes is 6 AM - 8 AM and 5 PM - 6 PM this coincides with the average work day. When looking by gender the trip times by day are the same, just Males use the bikes more than females. Males make up the majority of Subscribers and use the bikes throughout the week. There are also seemingly more Female Subcribers than Female Customers. Looking at the major start and end stations we can see that they are concentrated in the middle of the city with a few outside Manhattan. 

For a bike sharing program to succeed in Des Moines, bikes should be stationed as centeral as possible. Gender demographic of the city should be considered, as if there are more females than males in the city then useage may not be enough for it to be profitable. Also more data should be gathered around weather and trips taken. Des Moines likely has harsher and longer winters than NYC so this should be taken into account before starting a program there. Also research into "bike-ability" should be done before presenting. As NYC has a history of people biking in the city vs Des Moines which is likely a car driven city and may not have the avenues for bikes to be safely rode through the city. This would greatly impact the success of the program.
